    "    - Identify key statistics or data points requested (e.g., average/mean, maximum or standard deviation).\n",

    "        - The table `county_political_reporting` contains information about the party in control of counties.\n",
    "        - The table `rcra_violations` contains information about federally regulated facilities who have RCRA violations.\n",
    "        - The table `toxic_emissions` contains information about toxic pollutant emissions from the facilities.\n",
    "3. **Select the Appropriate Columns:**\n",
    "   - Use only the columns relevant to the question.\n",
    "4. **Understand any Filtering:**\n",
    "   - Pay close attention to any filtering criteria in the question. For example, if the question specifies a particular year, state, county, facility name or pollutant ensure that the SQL query includes a `WHERE` clause to filter the data accordingly.\n",
    "4. **Construct the SQL Query:**\n",
    "   - Use aggregate functions like `AVG`, `MAX`, or `MIN` as needed using `GROUP BY`.\n",
    "   - If a column has `count` in the name, then it should be summed.\n",
    "   - If the question involves ranking (e.g., \"top 5 violators\"), use `ORDER BY` with the appropriate column.\n",
    "5. **Limit the Results:**\n",
    "   - Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of results to {top_k} if the total number of results exceeds 50, unless specified otherwise.\n",

      "Assistant: I’m a large language model. When you ask me a question or provide me with a prompt, I analyze what you say and generate a response that is relevant and accurate. I'm constantly learning and improving, so over time I'll be even better at assisting you. Is there anything I can help you with?\n",
      "Assistant: The infamous US tax code! I'll provide an overview of the current state of the US tax code, but keep in mind that it's a complex and constantly evolving system. Here are some key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Structure:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Internal Revenue Code (IRC):** The IRC is the primary law governing federal taxation in the United States. It consists of 26 chapters, each addressing a specific aspect of taxation.\n",
      "2. **Tax Laws:** Various tax laws, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, have amended the IRC over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Components:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Income Tax:** The US has a progressive income tax system, with seven tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%.\n",
      "2. **Tax Brackets:** Taxpayers are classified into different tax brackets based on their taxable income.\n",
      "3. **Standard Deduction and Itemized Deductions:** Taxpayers can choose between the standard deduction (a fixed amount) or itemize deductions (deduct specific expenses).\n",
      "4. **Tax Credits:** Tax credits directly reduce a taxpayer's liability, whereas deductions only reduce taxable income.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Major Tax Laws:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA):** Signed into law in 2017, the TCJA made significant changes to individual and corporate tax rates.\n",
      "2. **Estate and Gift Tax:** The TCJA doubled the estate and gift tax exemption to $11.4 million per person (2023).\n",
      "3. **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT):** A separate tax system designed to ensure high-income taxpayers pay a minimum amount of taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tax Forms:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **1040:** The most common form for individual income tax returns.\n",
      "2. **W-2 and 1099:** Forms used to report wages, salaries, and other income.\n",
      "3. **Schedule A:** Used for itemized deductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tax Credits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC):** A refundable credit for low-to-moderate-income working individuals.\n",
      "2. **Child Tax Credit:** A non-refundable credit for families with qualifying children.\n",
      "3. **Education Credits:** The American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tax-Related Obligations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Filing Requirements:** Taxpayers must file a tax return if their gross income exceeds certain thresholds (e.g., $12,950 for single filers in 2022).\n",
      "2. **Payment Deadlines:** Quarterly estimated tax payments are due on April 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and January 15th of the following year.\n",
      "3. **Tax Audits:** The IRS may conduct audits to verify taxpayer compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other Key Aspects:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **State Taxes:** Each state has its own tax laws and rates, which can be more or less favorable than federal taxes.\n",
      "2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** 401(k), IRA, and Roth IRA accounts allow taxpayers to delay paying taxes on retirement savings.\n",
      "3. **Tax-Free Income:** Certain types of income, such as municipal bond interest and some scholarships, are tax-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a condensed overview of the US tax code. If you have specific questions or need help with a particular aspect, feel free to ask!\n",
      "Goodbye!\n"
